## 📖 What This Series Covers

In this series, I'll be learning and implementing core DSA concepts using Java.  
The focus will be on understanding the logic, solving problems efficiently, and preparing for coding interviews.

I'll be covering:

- Java fundamentals essential for DSA
- Array and string manipulation
- Recursion, backtracking, and divide & conquer
- Linked Lists, Stacks, and Queues
- Trees and Graphs
- Searching, Sorting, and Hashing
- Greedy algorithms and Dynamic Programming
- Advanced topics like Tries, Heaps, and more

Each topic will include code, logic explanation, and time-space complexity notes to help reinforce understanding.
